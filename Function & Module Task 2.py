Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Asks the user for a number as input.
2.   Uses the math module to calculate the:
o   Square root of the number
o   Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
o   Sine of the number (in radians)
3.   Displays the calculated results.

print(f"The entered number is = {num}")
print(f"Square root of {num} is  =",math.sqrt(num))
print(f"Natural logarithm of {num} is = ",math.log(num))
print(f"Sin of {num} is =",math.sin(num))
